# WO-004: Create media/ and extras/ Directories

## Description
Create the standard `media/` and `extras/` directories in the skin's root folder. These directories serve as dedicated locations for various skin assets such as images, icons, sounds, and other supplementary files. While they will be empty initially, their presence establishes the expected folder structure for future asset integration.

## Files Touched
- Creation of directory `media/`
- Creation of directory `extras/`

## Acceptance Criteria
- A directory named `media/` exists directly within `skin.genesis/`.
- A directory named `extras/` exists directly within `skin.genesis/`.
- Both directories are initially empty.

## Manual Visual Test Checklist
N/A (This is a non-visual, structural task. The presence of these empty directories does not directly impact the visual output of the skin).
- Verify directory creation using a file browser or command line.
