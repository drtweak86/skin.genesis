# WO-020: Placeholder for TMDbHelper and Trakt Integration (Conceptual)

## Description
This Work Order is conceptual and serves as a planning document for the future integration of TMDbHelper and Trakt services. It outlines the intended role and approach for using these data sources, without implementing any specific code. It establishes the groundwork for subsequent, concrete implementation WOs.

## Files Touched
N/A (This is a conceptual planning document, no code changes are made).

## Acceptance Criteria
- A clear, concise plan for integrating TMDbHelper is documented, detailing its use for movie and TV show metadata retrieval.
- A clear, concise plan for integrating Trakt is documented, detailing its use for watchlist synchronization, progress tracking, and scrobbling.
- The documentation acknowledges the performance constraints (Pi-first) when planning API calls and data processing from these services.

## Manual Visual Test Checklist
N/A (This is a conceptual planning document, there are no visual elements to test).
- Review of the documented plan for clarity, completeness, and adherence to the Genesis Vision and Architecture.
